Fruit shop needs a platform to manage their products and sells.
This platform should contain a place to manage products another one for sells and should require a login to use it.
Requirements:
- django admin resources are not allowed
- virtualenv
- python3.6
- django1.11 or django2
- Pages (as templates):
--- login
--- CRUD for products
--- CRUD for sells
--- must exist a logout button somewhere
- at least three apps (products, sells, users)
- mandatory to use javascript or jquery
- all CRUDs should be handle through an API (can be in the apps or have a app just for that)
- all create and update and delete calls should be executed through javascript (ajax ...)
- unit/functional tests for each app (can be something simple like call an API and check response status)
- the project should have a normal folder structure (docs, src, tests, requirments.txt)
- documentation is mandatory (even if short) and should at least contain information on how to run project and tests
- it can be delivered via git
